-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack pcmsolver-1.2.3-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./pcmsolver-1.2.3-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/pcmsolver-1.2.3-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/pcmsolver-1.2.3-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libpcm1-1.2.3-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libpcm-devel-1.2.3-X.tar.xz
