CATEGORY="Utils"
SUMMARY="Small shell utility, similar to expect(1)"
DESCRIPTION="empty is an utility that provides an interface to execute and/or interact with
processes under pseudo-terminal sessions (PTYs). This tool is definitely
useful in programming of shell scripts designed to communicate with
interactive programs like telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. In some cases empty can be
the simplest replacement for TCL/expect or other similar programming tools."
