actor-framework
------------------------------------------
An Open Source Implementation of the Actor Model in C++

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.1.2-1
  libcaf0.17.3-0.17.3-1bl1
  libgcc1-7.4.0-1
  libOpenCL1-2.2.12-1
  libssl1.1-1.1.1d-1
  libstdc++6-7.4.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.29-1
  cmake-3.14.5-1
  cygport-0.33.1-1
  gcc-core-7.4.0-1
  gcc-g++-7.4.0-1
  libprotobuf-devel-3.7.1-1
  ninja-1.9.0-1

Canonical download:
  https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/archive/0.17.3.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack actor-framework-0.17.3-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./actor-framework-0.17.3-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/actor-framework-0.17.3-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/actor-framework-0.17.3-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libcaf0.17.3-0.17.3-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libcaf-devel-0.17.3-X.tar.xz
