SUMMARY="Game programming library"
DESCRIPTION="Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia
programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as creating windows,
accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and
generally abstracting away the underlying platform. However, Allegro is not a
game engine: you are free to design and structure your program as you like."
