inherit python3-wheel

CATEGORY="Python"
SUMMARY="Namespace control and lazy-import mechanism"
DESCRIPTION="With apipkg you can control the exported namespace of a Python package and
greatly reduce the number of imports for your users. It is a small pure Python
module that works on CPython 2.7 and 3.4+, Jython and PyPy. It cooperates well
with Pythonâ€™s help() system, custom importers (PEP302) and common command-line
completion tools."
