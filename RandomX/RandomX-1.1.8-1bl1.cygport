SUMMARY="Proof of work algorithm based on random code execution"
DESCRIPTION="RandomX is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that is optimized for
general-purpose CPUs. RandomX uses random code execution (hence the name)
together with several memory-hard techniques to minimize the efficiency
advantage of specialized hardware."
